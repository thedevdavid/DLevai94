Freelance Product Engineer, Indie Developer & Content Creator.

I create content about being a solopreneur product engineer and building production-ready apps. Twitter, YouTube, and my blog.

Since my teenage years, I have worked as a freelance full-stack developer mostly with startups and small businesses. As of 2023, I'm building businesses in public, and helping developers become entrepreneurs.
